# First Week Algorithms

Each algorithm will have its description marked:

```javascript
/*
  This should sum up 3 numbers

  ex:
    var sum = add3Numbers(1, 2, 3);
      // should be 6
*/
```

Under the definition, you should see a function to test the algorithm

```javascript
function test ()
{
  var sum = add3Numbers(1, 2, 3);

  console.log('EXPECTED:', 1+2+3);
  console.log('ACTUAL:  ', sum);
}
```
